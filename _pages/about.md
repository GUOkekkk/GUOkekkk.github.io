Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

I am currently a Master 2 student majoring in [Advanced Robotics](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/study/masters/advanced-robotics-coro-imaro) ðŸ¤– at [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/), France. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Olivier Kermorgant](http://pagesperso.ls2n.fr/~kermorgant-o/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in MathematicsðŸ“–(in Information and Computing Science track) supervised by Professor [Huan Su](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/suhuan) from [HIT](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) in 2021.

For now I am doing my internship as the research enginner supervised by [Thibault Neveu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibaultneveu/) in [Visual Behavior](https://visualbehavior.ai/), an excellent company located in Lyon, France, which focuses on the field of the robots autonomy and computer vision.

My passion lies at the intersection of innovation and technology, the academic and the industry, particularly within the field of robotics. My research focus centers around such as robotic vision, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), human-robot interaction, and the application of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in robotics.

I am driven by the ambition to harness the power of robotics in order to liberate human potential from the constraints of heavy manual labor, thus enabling individuals to concentrate more on innovative and creative pursuits and not to be limited by the predetermined answers given by the LLM ðŸ™ƒ .
